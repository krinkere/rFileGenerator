This project demonstrates how to generate rFile in a directory of your choice and then import freshly created rFile into Accumulo table of your choice. 

Some configuration will be required. You would need to specify your Accumulo settings such as instance, username, and password. Also, I chose to store rFiles directly in HDSF vs on my machine, so you would have to specify location of your NameNode.
